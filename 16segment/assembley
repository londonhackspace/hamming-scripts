corners are square with the large holes on the outside

the top and bottom of the corner peices are shorter than the sides

There are 2 pairs of "T" peices, the narrower ones are for the top and bottom,
the wider ones for the sides

the center piece is the right way round when the top and bottom are shorter
than the sides.

Do a test fit before glueing!
